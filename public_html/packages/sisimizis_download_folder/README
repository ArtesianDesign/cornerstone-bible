Manual installation: 
Copy the inner "sisimizis_download_folder" folder (from inside the "blocks" folder) to the /blocks folder of your
concrete5 installation (the outer one on c5's root where index.php resides). Do NOT change its folder's name. 
Open c5 dashboard, go to "Add Functionality", scroll down the list, install the new block and enjoy. 

Configuring hints: 
- When configuring Sisimizi's Download Folder block, be careful which folders/directories you choose. 
"Path to download folder" is a path relative from c5's root folder and MUST be on the same server.
If the path begins with ./ it means it is within c5's root folder or below, with ../ it is outside c5's root.
- If your download folder is inside c5's directory structure, take care that it's name does not collide with any
of your concrete5 page aliases. An example for a relative path within c5 would look like ./mydownloads/
- If your download folder is on the same server but outside c5's directory structure, you probably use a subdomain
or redirection to access the folder. An example for a relative path outside c5 would look like ../files/public/
- If you use a subdomain or redirection for accessing your download folder, you have to add it on "Subdomain URL"
field as a full URL like http://download.sisimizi.org/ or http://download.sisimizi.org/software/
- The Sisimizi's Download Folder block will try to substitute missing prefixes and slashes on relative path and 
subdomain URL, but you should be careful that you insert valid paths/URLs. 
- The listing will not show inner subdirectories, (..) for navigating folders and .htaccess files. For excluding other 
specific files you can edit line 29 on file view.php ("read filelist" section) - but again, be careful about what you do.


*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
- If you want to force browsers downloading files instead of opening in the browser or starting a linked application,
you should add such lines for any fileformat to a .htaccess file in your download folder:

AddType application/x-msdownload txt
AddType application/x-msdownload mp3
...

This example is for text (*.txt) and MP3 (*.mp3) files, you can add it for all file types you need.
It works for most browsers and file types, but you have to empty your browser cache to see the effect, 
if you opened any file before! 


Enjoy :)
